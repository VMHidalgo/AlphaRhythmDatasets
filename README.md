# Alpha Rhythm Datasets
The repo intends to index public alpha rhythm datasets. A comprehensive list would help researchers interested in this EEG signal. New are a

* **Datasets**
  1.  [EEG Alpha Waves dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2348892#.X1pudYYpA68): This dataset contains electroencephalographic recordings of subjects in a simple resting-state eyes open/closed experimental protocol. Data were recorded during a pilot experiment taking place in the GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France, in 2017
  
  2. [A mind-brain-body dataset of MRI, EEG, cognition, emotion, and peripheral physiology in young and old adults](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018308):We present a publicly available dataset of 227 healthy participants comprising a young (N=153, 25.1±3.1 years, range 20–35 years, 45 female) and an elderly group (N=74, 67.6±4.7 years, range 59–77 years, 37 female) acquired cross-sectionally in Leipzig, Germany, between 2013 and 2015 to study mind-body-emotion interactions. During a two-day assessment, participants completed MRI at 3 Tesla (resting-state fMRI, quantitative T1 (MP2RAGE), T2-weighted, FLAIR, SWI/QSM, DWI) and a 62-channel EEG experiment at rest.
